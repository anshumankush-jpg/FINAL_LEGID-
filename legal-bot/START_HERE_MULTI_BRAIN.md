## 🎯 THE KEY DIFFERENCE

### Old AI (Single-Path)
```
"You should file a complaint with the board. 
It takes 3-6 months. Consult a lawyer."
```

### Multi-Brain AI (Strategic Options)
```
UNPAID RENT DEPOSIT – ONTARIO TENANT RIGHTS

You have THREE realistic options:

OPTION 1 – LTB APPLICATION
Likelihood: HIGH
Pros: Binding decision, can claim interest
Cons: Takes 6-12 months, $53 fee
Best for: Significant amounts, documented case

OPTION 2 – DEMAND LETTER + THREAT
Likelihood: MEDIUM-HIGH
Pros: Fast (2-4 weeks), often works
Cons: Not binding, may be ignored
Best for: Need money quickly

OPTION 3 – NEGOTIATE SETTLEMENT
Likelihood: MEDIUM
Pros: Can resolve in days
Cons: Accept less than entitled
Best for: Urgent need, small amounts

[+ Sample demand letter]
[+ Step-by-step action plan]
[+ Risk warnings]
[+ When to hire a lawyer]
```

See the difference? **Strategic, intelligent, useful.**
