## 🎬 EXAMPLE OUTPUT (Refined Version)

### User Asks:
> "My condo flooded from the unit above in Ontario"

### LEGID Refined Response:

```
CONDO WATER DAMAGE FROM UPSTAIRS UNIT – ONTARIO RIGHTS & REMEDIES

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
You have legal rights to compensation if the upstairs unit owner was negligent. 
The Ontario Condominium Act and common law negligence principles apply. You 
need to act quickly to document the damage and notify the appropriate parties.

LEGAL CONTEXT & BACKGROUND
Under Ontario's Condominium Act, 1998, unit owners are responsible for 
maintaining and repairing their own units. When water damage occurs from one 
unit to another, the owner of the source unit may be liable for negligence if 
they failed to properly maintain their unit or fix known issues.

Common law negligence principles also apply: a unit owner has a duty of care 
to prevent foreseeable harm to neighboring units.

MULTI-PATH ANALYSIS – YOUR OPTIONS

OPTION 1 – INSURANCE CLAIM + CIVIL NEGLIGENCE ACTION
What this involves: File a claim with your own insurance for immediate 
coverage, then pursue the upstairs owner for damages.

When it applies: When damage is significant ($5,000+) and you have 
comprehensive unit insurance.

Why it usually works: Your insurance pays quickly (within 30-60 days), then 
subrogates (seeks reimbursement) from the upstairs owner's insurance. This 
is the most common path.

Likelihood of success: HIGH (80-90% of cases resolve this way)

Downsides or limits:
- Your insurance deductible applies ($500-$2,000 typically)
- Subrogation can take 6-12 months
- May affect your insurance premiums if you make multiple claims

OPTION 2 – DIRECT DEMAND TO UPSTAIRS OWNER
What this involves: Send a formal demand letter to the upstairs owner 
requesting immediate payment for damages, bypassing insurance.

When it applies: When damage is moderate ($2,000-$10,000) and you want 
faster resolution without insurance involvement.

Why it usually works: Many owners prefer to pay directly to avoid insurance 
claims that could raise their premiums.

Likelihood of success: MEDIUM (50-60% success rate)

Downsides or limits:
- Upstairs owner may refuse or delay
- No insurance backing if they don't pay
- May need to escalate to legal action anyway

OPTION 3 – CONDO CORPORATION MEDIATION
What this involves: Request the condo board/property manager to mediate 
between you and the upstairs owner, potentially using the corporation's 
insurance.

When it applies: When the issue involves common elements (shared plumbing, 
roof leaks) or when the corporation may have some liability.

Why it usually works: Condo corporations often have insurance that covers 
certain types of water damage, and they have leverage over unit owners.

Likelihood of success: MEDIUM-HIGH (70% if corporation is involved)

Downsides or limits:
- Corporation may deny involvement if it's clearly unit-to-unit damage
- Process can be slow (2-4 months)
- May not cover all your damages

PRACTICAL NEXT STEPS (ACTION PLAN)

Step 1 – Document Everything (DO THIS IMMEDIATELY)
- Take photos and videos of all damage before cleanup
- Create detailed written inventory of damaged items with values
- Save all receipts for temporary accommodations, cleaning, repairs
- Keep damaged items until insurance adjusters view them

Step 2 – Notify Relevant Parties (WITHIN 48 HOURS)
Send written notice to:
- The upstairs unit owner (certified mail recommended)
- Your property management company
- The condo corporation board
Include: date/time of incident, description of damage, request for inspection

Step 3 – Report to Insurance (WITHIN 72 HOURS)
Contact your unit insurance provider immediately. They will send an adjuster 
and may cover immediate damages. Ask about:
- Property damage coverage
- Temporary relocation coverage
- Loss of use coverage
- Subrogation process

Step 4 – Request Formal Inspection (WITHIN 1 WEEK)
Request that the property manager and/or condo board inspect both units to 
determine the source of the leak.

Step 5 – Preserve Evidence (ONGOING)
- Keep all damaged items until insurance adjusters have viewed them
- Maintain a log of all communications (dates, times, who you spoke with)
- Save all emails and written correspondence

SAMPLE COMMUNICATION

Subject: URGENT - Water Damage from Unit [Number] on [Date]

Dear [Property Manager/Board President/Upstairs Owner],

I am writing to formally notify you of water damage to my unit ([Your Unit 
Number]) that occurred on [Date] at approximately [Time].

Water leaked from the unit above mine ([Unit Number]) and caused significant 
damage to my [ceiling/walls/floors/furniture/belongings]. I have documented 
the damage with photographs and video.

I request:
1. An immediate inspection to determine the source of the leak
2. Confirmation of which party's insurance will cover the damage
3. Information about the condo corporation's role in this matter

I have already notified my insurance provider and am prepared to cooperate 
with all necessary inspections and investigations.

Please respond within 48 hours to confirm receipt of this notice and next steps.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Unit Number]
[Contact Information]

RISKS, WARNINGS & COMMON MISTAKES

Common Mistakes:
- Waiting too long (limitation period is 2 years in Ontario)
- Not keeping proof of deposit payment
- Accepting landlord's claim that deposit covered "damages" without proper 
  documentation
- Filing wrong form at LTB

Timeline Risks:
- LTB is severely backlogged (expect 6-12 months)
- Small Claims is faster (3-6 months) but more formal
- Demand letters work best within first 30 days after move-out

What Could Weaken Your Case:
- Missing documentation
- Unclear communications
- Accepting partial payment without written agreement

WHEN TO ESCALATE TO A LAWYER

Consider a lawyer if:
- Damage exceeds $35,000 (above Small Claims Court limit in Ontario)
- Upstairs owner or their insurance denies responsibility
- Your insurance claim is denied or significantly undervalued
- The condo corporation is unresponsive or unhelpful
- You need to relocate for an extended period
- There are health concerns (mold, structural damage)

A lawyer can help you:
- Navigate insurance disputes
- File a civil claim for negligence
- Negotiate settlements
- Assess whether the corporation has liability

Many lawyers offer free initial consultations for property damage cases. 
Paralegals can also assist with Small Claims Court matters at lower cost 
($500-$1,500).

IMPORTANT NOTES & DISCLAIMER
This guidance applies to Ontario, Canada under the Condominium Act, 1998 
and common law negligence principles. Other provinces have different rules 
and timelines. This is general legal information, not legal advice tailored 
to your specific situation. For advice about your particular case, including 
assessment of liability and damages, please consult a licensed lawyer or 
paralegal in Ontario.
