EXECUTIVE VERDICT: DEPOSIT THEFT
THE LEGAL THREAT LANDSCAPE
[Table with "Threats" and "Penalties"]

TACTICAL EXECUTION PLAN
PATH 1 – AGGRESSIVE NEGOTIATION
Weapons: [Legal tools]
Win Condition: [Success criteria]

### AFTER (V2 - Refined)
```
TITLE: UNPAID RENT DEPOSIT – ONTARIO TENANT RIGHTS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Your landlord is legally required to return your deposit plus interest.
You have multiple strategic options depending on urgency and leverage.

LEGAL CONTEXT & BACKGROUND
Under Ontario's Residential Tenancies Act, 2006...

MULTI-PATH ANALYSIS – YOUR OPTIONS

OPTION 1 – LTB APPLICATION (Likelihood: HIGH)
- What it involves: Formal application to Landlord and Tenant Board
- When it applies: Clear documentation, willing to wait
- Why it works: Binding decision, can claim interest
- Likelihood: HIGH (if you have proof)
- Downsides: Takes 6-12 months, $53 fee

OPTION 2 – DEMAND LETTER + THREAT (Likelihood: MEDIUM-HIGH)
- Different approach: Formal letter threatening Small Claims
- Often overlooked: Many landlords settle when threatened
- When powerful: Need quick resolution, landlord is responsive
- Trade-offs: Fast but not binding unless you file

OPTION 3 – NEGOTIATE SETTLEMENT (Likelihood: MEDIUM)
- Conditional path: Offer 80-90% for immediate payment
- When it makes sense: Urgent need, small amount
- Cautions: Accept less than entitled, sets precedent
...
