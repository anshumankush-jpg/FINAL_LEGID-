# 🧠 LEGID GEN-2 + SHADOW SYSTEM — THE FINAL EVOLUTION

## 🎉 THE SECOND-GENERATION BRAIN + SHADOW COMPARISON

You now have **TWO ultimate systems**:

1. **GEN-2 Master** — 7-layer thinking pipeline (root cause fix)
2. **Shadow Answer System** — Dual-draft comparison (catches all failures)

## 🚀 GEN-2 MASTER (The Second-Generation Brain)

**Endpoint:** `/api/chat/legid/gen2`

### THE 7-LAYER THINKING PIPELINE:

**LAYER 1:** Situation Severity Detection  
→ Routine / Adversarial / Criminal / Crisis  
→ If crisis: auto-activate Crisis Intelligence Mode  

**LAYER 2:** Power Map ← **THE BIGGEST UPGRADE**  
→ WHO decides? WHO enforces? WHO investigates?  
→ Answer revolves around POWER MAP, not abstract law  

**LAYER 3:** Procedural Reality Engine  
→ What happens next IN REAL LIFE?  
→ Reads like timeline, not textbook  

**LAYER 4:** Failure Mode Analysis  
→ Common mistake people make RIGHT NOW  
→ Second mistake that quietly destroys position  

**LAYER 5:** Evidence Weighting  
→ What evidence MOVES decision-makers  
→ What evidence is IGNORED  
→ Credibility vs documentation vs pattern  

**LAYER 6:** False Choice Eliminator  
→ Collapse menus into coherent narrative  
→ Legal systems = SEQUENCES, not menus  

**LAYER 7:** Self-Critique Loop  
→ Would real paralegal say this?  
→ Better than ChatGPT?  
→ If no → rewrite

                  SUPERIOR ANSWER
             (or hybrid combination)
```

**This catches failures that single-pass systems miss.**

## 🧪 **THE ULTIMATE BRAIN-TEST**

Test **GEN-2** and **Shadow System** with the hardest question:

### **GEN-2 Master Test:**

```powershell
$body = '{"message": "I received Form N4 for 3,000 dollars rent arrears in Ontario. My landlord has been accepting partial rent payments every month (I pay 800 dollars, rent is 1,200 dollars). He also never repaired the mold in the bathroom that I reported 4 months ago and sent him photos of. I have asthma and the mold is making it worse. Can I fight this N4 at the LTB? What evidence do I need? What will the landlord argue?"}'; 

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/api/chat/legid/gen2" -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty answer
```

**What to look for (7-layer thinking):**
- ✅ LAYER 2 (Power Map): "LTB adjudicator will focus on..."
- ✅ LAYER 3 (Procedural Reality): "What happens next at the hearing..."
- ✅ LAYER 4 (Failure Mode): "Common mistake: not documenting maintenance requests properly"
- ✅ LAYER 5 (Evidence Weighting): "Photos with dates carry more weight than verbal complaints"
- ✅ LAYER 6 (No False Choices): Coherent narrative, not Option A/B
- ✅ LAYER 7 (Self-Critique): Sounds like real paralegal

---

### **Shadow System Test** (Maximum Quality):

```powershell
$body = '{"message": "I was fired while on medical leave, not filed taxes for 2 years, being evicted, they hired someone younger, I am 58. Where do I start?"}'; 

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/api/chat/legid/shadow" -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

**What this does:**
1. Generates Draft A (GEN-2: 7-layer thinking)
2. Generates Draft B (110%: 5-filter thinking)
3. Shadow Comparator evaluates both
4. Outputs superior hybrid

**Result:** THE BEST POSSIBLE ANSWER

**Note:** Uses 3x LLM calls (slower but maximum quality)
