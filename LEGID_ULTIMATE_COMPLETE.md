## 📊 SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARISON

### Question: *"I earned $18,000 in Canada. Employer deducted $1,200. Do I have to file? Will I get money back?"*

**LEGID Master Response:**
```
1️⃣ ISSUE IDENTIFICATION
The question concerns tax filing obligations...

2️⃣ GOVERNING LAW / LEGAL FRAMEWORK
Income Tax Act, administered by CRA...

3️⃣ LEGAL ANALYSIS
[Formal structured analysis...]
```
Style: Formal legal memo

---

**Human Paralegal Response:**
```
In Canada, whether you need to file a tax return depends on a few factors, 
including your total income and the deductions made. Since you earned $18,000 
and had $1,200 deducted, here's how it generally works:

1. Filing Requirement: If your total income is above the basic personal amount, 
   which is around $15,000 for 2023, you are required to file a tax return...

3. Refund Possibility: If your total tax liability is less than the amount 
   withheld ($1,200), you could receive a refund. For example, if your 
   calculated tax is only $800, you would get back the difference of $400.

In practice, many people in your situation do end up getting some money back, 
especially if they have low income and qualify for credits...
```
Style: **Natural conversation, anxiety-aware, practical**

**Notice:** Uses numbers for clarity, but NO rigid template structure!
