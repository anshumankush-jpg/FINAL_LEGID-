# 🏆 GOLD STANDARD 110% EXAMPLE — The Perfect Rewrite

## 📊 **BEFORE (70%) vs AFTER (110%)**

### **Question:**
*"I got injured at work in Ontario (back pain lifting boxes). My employer said to wait and see if it gets better. It's been 3 months and still hurts. Should I report to WSIB now or is it too late?"*

---

## ❌ **BEFORE (Current LEGID ~70%)**

```
I can help — quick questions so I don't misguide you:
1. What province are you in?
2. Have you seen a doctor?
3. Did you report it to your employer?

QUICK TAKE:
You should report to WSIB.

WHAT I UNDERSTOOD:
- Injury: back pain
- Occurred: 3 months ago
- Employer: said wait
- Status: Still hurts

YOUR OPTIONS:

Option A: Report to WSIB Now
Pros:
- Can get benefits
- Still within reporting window
Cons:
- Employer might be upset
- Process takes time
Risk Level: Low

Option B: Wait Longer
Pros:
- Avoid conflict
- Might heal on own
Cons:
- Claim may be denied
- Lose benefits
Risk Level: High

NEXT STEPS:
1. See a doctor
2. File Form 7
3. Keep records

Relevant law: Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, 1997

**Problems:**
- ❌ Opens with questions
- ❌ Template sections everywhere
- ❌ "Options A/B" creates false choice
- ❌ Doesn't explain WHY employer said "wait"
- ❌ Doesn't explain what WSIB actually weighs
- ❌ Over-simplified ("just report")
- ❌ Weak power dynamics

## ✅ **AFTER (110% Gold Standard)**

```
Based on what you've described, this follows a very common pattern in Ontario 
workplace injuries, and there are specific things about the "wait and see" advice 
that matter more than most workers realize.

When an employer suggests waiting instead of filing a WSIB claim immediately, 
it's usually not because they're looking out for your recovery. Employers benefit 
from delayed reporting because it gives them time to frame the injury differently 
— questioning whether it happened at work, whether it's as serious as claimed, or 
whether you continued working normally afterward. WSIB adjudicators notice these 
patterns.

Three months is not "too late" in the formal sense — you generally have up to 
six months to report a workplace injury in Ontario. But delay creates a credibility 
problem. WSIB will ask: if the pain was severe enough to claim benefits for, why 
did you wait three months?

What WSIB adjudicators actually weigh in back injury cases:

- Early medical documentation that links the pain directly to the workplace incident
- Whether you reported the injury to your employer in writing at the time it happened
- Whether you kept working or stopped immediately
- Consistency between what you told the doctor, what you told your employer, and 
  what you're now telling WSIB

The most common mistake at this stage: workers file a WSIB claim without first 
getting medical records that clearly state "workplace-related back injury from 
lifting boxes on [date]." If your medical file just says "back pain," WSIB and 
the employer will both argue it could have come from anywhere.

The second mistake: not having written proof that you reported the injury to your 
employer when it happened. If you only told them verbally, and they now say "we 
didn't know," it becomes a credibility contest.

What to do right now:

- See a doctor and explain exactly when and how the injury happened at work (be specific: 
  date, task, what you were lifting)
- Request a copy of any workplace incident reports or records your employer may have
- Write down everything you remember about the incident and who witnessed it
- File your WSIB Form 7 (Worker's Report of Injury/Disease) immediately — delay only 
  makes the credibility gap worse

Your employer cannot legally punish you for filing a WSIB claim. If they pressure 
you not to file, that is a separate violation under the Workplace Safety and Insurance 
Act.

General information only — not legal advice.

If it helps, I can explain what typically happens once WSIB receives your claim, or 
what employers commonly argue in back injury disputes.
