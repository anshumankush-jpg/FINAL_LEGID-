## 🔥 **THE 7-LAYER GEN-2 THINKING PIPELINE**

**LAYER 1:** Situation Severity (Routine / Adversarial / Criminal / Crisis)  
**LAYER 2:** Power Map (WHO decides, enforces, investigates, benefits from delay)  
**LAYER 3:** Procedural Reality (what happens next IN REAL LIFE)  
**LAYER 4:** Failure Mode Analysis (common mistakes RIGHT NOW)  
**LAYER 5:** Evidence Weighting (what MOVES decision-makers vs ignored)  
**LAYER 6:** False Choice Eliminator (sequences, not menus)  
**LAYER 7:** Self-Critique Loop (better than ChatGPT?)

## 🧪 **FINAL DEMO QUESTIONS** (Copy-Paste Ready)

### **Test 1: GEN-2 (7-Layer Brain)**

```powershell
$body = '{"message": "I received Form N4 for 3,000 dollars rent arrears in Ontario. Landlord accepts partial payments monthly (I pay 800, rent is 1,200). Never fixed mold I reported 4 months ago with photos. I have asthma. Can I fight this N4? What evidence? What will landlord argue?"}'; 

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/api/chat/legid/gen2" -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty answer
```

**Expect:**
- ✅ Power map: "LTB adjudicator will scrutinize..."
- ✅ Evidence weighting: "Photos with dates carry more weight than..."
- ✅ Failure mode: "Common mistake: not documenting maintenance requests properly"
- ✅ Procedural reality: "What usually happens at the hearing..."

---

### **Test 2: Shadow System (Dual-Draft Maximum Quality)**

```powershell
$body = '{"message": "Fired while on medical leave, not filed taxes 2 years, being evicted, they hired someone younger, I am 58. Where start?"}'; 

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/api/chat/legid/shadow" -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty answer
```

**Expect:**
- ✅ Best of GEN-2 + 110% combined
- ✅ Multi-issue prioritization
- ✅ Urgency-aware
- ✅ Empathetic tone
- ✅ Strategic action plan

## 🔥 **WHY GEN-2 IS THE ROOT FIX**

### **Before (Generic Template):**
```
Quick Take: You can dispute the N4.

What I Understood:
- Arrears: $3,000
- Partial payments: Yes
- Mold issue: Reported

Your Options:
Option A: Fight at LTB
Option B: Pay arrears

Pros/Cons: [generic list]
```

### **After (GEN-2 Transformation):**
```
Form N4 situations involving partial payment acceptance create a specific 
procedural problem that LTB adjudicators examine carefully.

When a landlord accepts partial rent after serving an N4, they may be waiving 
the termination. The LTB will look at whether the landlord's conduct—accepting 
$800 monthly—created a new payment arrangement or undermined the termination date.

The mold issue connects because landlord maintenance failures can support a 
rent abatement claim. If you can show the landlord failed their RTA obligations, 
the LTB may offset arrears. What they'll want to see: dated written complaints, 
photo progression, medical documentation tying asthma to mold exposure, and 
evidence of landlord's response or silence.

Common mistake at this stage: people treat arrears and maintenance as separate 
issues. They're connected—rent abatement can reduce what you owe.

Second mistake: not documenting everything. LTB decides on evidence, not 
explanations.

What you should gather now:
- All written communications about mold (emails, texts, letters)
- Photos showing dates and progression
- Medical records or doctor's note
- Rent payment history showing the $800 pattern

General information only — not legal advice.

If it helps, we can look at what typically happens at an LTB hearing when both 
arrears and maintenance are in play, or what makes N4 service defective.
```

**See the difference?**
- ❌ No templates
- ✅ Power map ("LTB adjudicators examine carefully")
- ✅ Evidence weighting ("What they'll want to see")
- ✅ Failure modes ("Common mistake")
- ✅ Procedural reality ("What connects")
- ✅ Natural follow-ups
