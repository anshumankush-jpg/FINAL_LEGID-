## 🎯 **WHAT'S WORKING** (Real Progress)

### ✅ **1. Correct Authority Identification**
- LEGID correctly focused on WSIB as decision-maker
- Mentioned reporting timelines
- Discussed medical evidence
- Explained causation

**This is authority-thinking** (the core of 110%)

### ✅ **2. No Wrong-Law Hallucinations**
- No Miranda warnings
- No irrelevant landlord cases
- No unrelated doctrine
- Jurisdiction-correct

**This raises trust significantly**

### ✅ **3. Some Useful Guidance**
- "Common mistakes" section
- "What WSIB cares about"
- Closer to paralegal explanation

**This is real progress** (~70%)

## ❌ **WHAT'S BLOCKING 100-110%** (The 4 Blockers)

### **Blocker #1: Opening with Questions** ← **FATAL (Caps at 75%)**

```
"I can help — quick questions so I don't misguide you…"
```

**Problem:**
- Facts are sufficient
- Real paralegal would explain first
- Asking first reduces confidence
- Feels scripted

**Fix:** Delete opening, start with calm direct explanation

---

### **Blocker #2: Template Disease** ← **BIGGEST BARRIER**

Still uses:
- ❌ QUICK TAKE
- ❌ WHAT I UNDERSTOOD
- ❌ YOUR OPTIONS
- ❌ Pros / Cons
- ❌ Risk Level
- ❌ NEXT STEPS

**Problem:**
- Makes law feel like checklist
- Creates false choices
- Suppresses narrative reasoning

**Fix:** Delete all template sections, rewrite as flowing narrative

---

### **Blocker #3: Over-Simplified Framing**

Says "report to WSIB" but doesn't explain:
- Why employers discourage reporting
- What happens if you report while still working
- How WSIB treats "worker fault"
- How delay affects credibility

**Problem:**
- Says WHAT to do
- Doesn't explain WHY system reacts this way

**Fix:** Inject power dynamics + procedural reality

---

### **Blocker #4: Not Enough Power Dynamics**

Needs to explain:
- Employer vs worker vs WSIB incentives
- Why "fault" often doesn't matter as workers think
- Why early medical documentation outweighs employer statements

**Problem:**
- Hints at this but doesn't center answer on power

**Fix:** Authority-first rewriting

## 📝 **NEXT STEP: THE DEMO REWRITE**

**You said:** *"Let me rewrite this WSIB answer into a perfect 110% version"*

**I say:** **YES! DO IT!**

**This will:**
- Show the exact difference between 70% and 110%
- Lock the pattern into prompts
- Give me the benchmark to enforce

**I'm ready to see the 110% version.** 🎯

---

**Please rewrite the WSIB answer to 110% standard and show me:**
1. The rewritten answer
2. What you changed (line-by-line if helpful)
3. Why each change moves it closer to 110%

**This will be the locked pattern.** 🔒
